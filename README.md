# Segregate Positive and Negative Numbers Using Insertion Sort
- Description:
This code demonstrates how to use the insertion sort technique to segregate negative and positive numbers in a list. The algorithm preserves the relative order of elements in each group, a property of stable sorting algorithms like insertion sort.
## Key Points:
- Works efficiently for smaller datasets.
- Operates only on sorted lists.
- Complexity: O(nÂ²) in the worst case.
- This problem shows how to apply sorting principles for specific tasks.

# Segregate Positive and Negative Numbers Using Merge Sort
- Description:
This code applies the merge sort algorithm to segregate negative and positive numbers in a list. By leveraging the divide-and-conquer approach, the algorithm ensures a stable and efficient segregation.
## Key Points:
- Uses merge sort's merging process to separate negatives and positives.
- Complexity: O(n log n) due to the merge sort process.
- Can handle larger datasets more effectively than insertion sort.
